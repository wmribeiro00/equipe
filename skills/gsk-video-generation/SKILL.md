## Local File Support

Parameters that accept URLs (`--image_urls`, `--audio_url`, `--video_url`, `--video_urls`) also accept local file paths. The CLI automatically uploads local files before sending to the API.

## Output File

Use `-o <path>` / `--output-file <path>` to download the generated result directly to a local file.
